The main topics addressed are: - The relationship between human beings and computers, - Software development as a human activity, - The use of computer programs in the human world, - The nature of computer science as a scientific discipline. Contributions by 33 authors belonging to different scientific disciplines are assembled to form a coherent whole. Some authors reflect on their own professional practice in computer science and system design. Others start from approaches developed in the humanities and the social sciences for understanding human learning and creativity, individual and cooperative work, and the interrelation between technology and organizations. Drawing on different philosophical traditions, they discuss the nature of software development and use as social processes in which we play an active role in constituting what we hold for real. The book will provide readers with theoretical foundations and a constructive orientation for practice in science and design.},

Naur strongly disputes the value of the role and orientation of the IS discipline around artifacts and argues that algorithmic methods do not lead to a theory of a domain. Such a viewpoint provides an alternative lens with which to view current developments and may lead to additional insights by providing the reader with a source for questioning and reﬂecting critically on the re-focusing of method design on conversation rather than artifact production . It is suggested that such a conversational framework based on Toulmin and Pask may provide a means to establish and test theory building views of enterprise architecture.},

	abstract = {Text editing is powerful, but some types of expressions are more naturally represented and manipulated graphically. Examples include expressions that compute colors, music, animations, tabular data, plots, diagrams, and other domainspecific data structures. This paper introduces live literals, or livelits, which allow clients to fill holes of types like these by directly manipulating a user-defined GUI embedded persistently into code. Uniquely, livelits are compositional: a livelit GUI can itself embed spliced expressions, which are typed, lexically scoped, and can in turn embed other livelits. Livelits are also uniquely live: a livelit can provide continuous feedback about the run-time implications of the client’s choices even when splices mention bound variables, because the system continuously gathers closures associated with the hole that the livelit is filling. We integrate livelits into Hazel, a live hole-driven programming environment, and describe case studies that exercise these novel capabilities. We then define a simply typed livelit calculus, which specifies how livelits operate as live graphical macros. The metatheory of macro expansion has been mechanized in Agda.},

It enables a user to prepare, analyze, and debug diagrammatic, yet precise, descriptions of the system under development from three interrelated points of view, capturing structure, functionality, and behavior. These views are represented by three graphical languages, the most intricate of which is the language of statecharts, used to depict reactive behavior over time. In addition to the use of statecharts, the main novelty of STATEMATE is in the fact that it understands the entire descriptions perfectly, to the point of being able to analyze them for crucial dynamic properties, to carry out rigorous executions and simulations of the described system, and to create running code automatically. These features are invaluable when it comes to the quality and reliability of the final outcome.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {In a series of studies in which consumers assembled IKEA boxes, folded origami, and built sets of Legos, we demonstrate and investigate the boundary conditions for what we term the “IKEA effect” – the increase in valuation of self-made products. Participants saw their amateurish creations – of both utilitarian and hedonic products – as similar in value to the creations of experts, and expected others to share their opinions. Our account suggests that labor leads to increased valuation only when labor results in successful completion of tasks; thus when participants built and then destroyed their creations, or failed to complete them, the IKEA effect dissipated. Finally, we show that labor increases valuation of completed products not just for consumers who profess an interest in “do-it-yourself” projects, but even for those who are relatively uninterested. We discuss the implications of the IKEA effect for marketing managers and organizations more generally.},

	abstract = {Program analysis tools, from simple static semantic analysis by a compiler, to complex dynamic analyses of data flow and security, have become commonplace in modern day programming. Many of the simpler analyses, such as the afore- mentioned compiler checking or linters designed to enforce code style, may even go unnoticed or unconsidered by most users, ubiquitous as they are. Despite this, and despite the obvious utility that such programming tools can provide, many warnings provided by them go unheeded by programmers most of the time.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}There are several reasons for this phenomenon: the propensity to produce false positives undermines confidence in the validity of warnings, the tools do not in- tegrate well into the normal workflow of the developer, sometimes the warning message is simply too esoteric for most users to understand, and so on. A com- mon theme can be drawn from these reasons for ignoring the often-times very useful information given by a programming tool: the tool itself is difficult to use.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}In this thesis, we consider ways in which we can bridge this gap between users and tools. To do this, we draw from observations about the way in which we interact with each other in the most basic human-to-human context. Applying these lessons to a human-tool interaction allow us to examine ways in which tools may be deficient, and investigate methods for making the interaction more natural and human-like.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}We explore this issue by framing the interaction as a "conversation" between a human and their development environment. We then present a new programming tool, Progger, built using design principles driven by the "conversational lens" which we use to look at these interactions. After this, we present a user study using a novel low-cost methodology, aimed at evaluating the efficacy of the Progger tool. From the results of this user study, we present a new, more streamlined version of Progger, and finally investigate the way in which it can be used to direct the users attention when conducting a code comprehension exercise.},

	abstract = {Programming is one of the essential and most difficult skills to learn in the computer field and other disciplines. Programming can seem more troublesome for novices who have not learned programming concepts, usage and other basic programming skills. To become a programmer, there are many things need to be considered in programming such as syntax, pragmatics and semantics. In addition, having a good knowledge about problem-solving techniques is vital. For instance, when some students face a new problem in programming courses and they feel understanding the problem is not easy, difficult tasks which students need to handle as well as, the manner of teaching programming may discourage them to do coding. Mostly, in the first phase of learning programming, they find it difficult, and they will not be inspired to do programming; this is one of the reasons that most students cannot do coding by themselves. An environment in which is a source and guidance to look for commands and explanations would be helpful, and interaction with teachers or friends can assist in overcoming most of the difficulties. This research aims to study about the effectiveness of learning the fundamental of problem solving in programming, as well as, learning these abilities in the early ages. This paper introduces and compares several existing problem-solving tools and shows how visual problem-solving techniques will help students to improve their programming skills. Furthermore, in this paper we analyze the experience of programming, problem solving tools and techniques and the role of social networks in programming based on gathered data which was collected through an online survey.},

This paper describes an exploratory study into the nature and importance of creativity in engineering design problem solving in relation to the possible impact of software design tools. The first stage of the study involved an empirical investigation in the form of a case study of the use of standard CAD tool sets and the development of a systems engineering software support tool. It was found that there were several ways in which CAD influenced the creative process, including enhancing visualisation and communication, premature fixation, circumscribed thinking and bounded ideation. The tool development experience uncovered the difficulty in supporting creative processes from the developer’s perspective. The issues were the necessity of making assumptions, achieving a balance between structure and flexibility, and the pitfalls of satisfying user wants and needs. The second part of the study involved the development of a model of the creative problem solving process in engineering design. This provided a possible explanation for why purpose designed engineering software tools might encourage an analytical problem solving approach and discourage a more creative approach.},

For this type of problem, the process used to create the software solution, in addition to meeting the goal of the solution, needs to produce a solution that can handle the effects of complexity in the problem domain. This paper examines forces that a complex problem domain places on the development of a software solution and how the software development process can affect the software product in relation to those forces. It focuses on how the practices of an agile software development methodology, in particular the Extreme Programming Methodology, embraces change and has practices that implicitly affect the design and implementation to meet the needs of software solutions for complex problem domains.},

It examines how it all students make sense of computational processes; by reporting on experimental observations that have been made with school children, and with university undergraduates. We observed little difference between children and adults with regard to how they learn about computation, and suggest that the strong similarities are due to a common set of problem-solving techniques which are fundamental to all problem based learning, in general, and learning about computation, in particular. To conclude, we demonstrate that our model --- based on software engineering concepts --- is useful when reasoning about the relationship between problem solving and learning to program.},

This paper provides an understanding of the difficulties faced by university students while learning programming language using problem-solving skills. The questionnaire used in the study has 32 items categorized into four dimensions of Analysis, Design, Coding and Testing.

	abstract = {General-purpose programming languages typically define literal notation for only a small number of common data structures, like lists. This is unsatisfying because there are many other data structures for which literal notation might be useful, e.g. finite maps, regular expressions, HTML elements, SQL queries, syntax trees for various languages and chemical structures. There may also be different implementations of each of these data structures behind a common interface that could all benefit from common literal notation. This paper introduces typed literal macros (TLMs), which allow library providers to define new literal notation of nearly arbitrary design at any specified type or parameterized family of types. Compared to existing approaches, TLMs are uniquely reasonable. TLM clients can reason abstractly, i.e. without examining grammars or generated expansions, about types and binding. The system only needs to convey to clients, via secondary notation, the inferred segmentation of each literal body, which gives the locations and types of spliced subterms. TLM providers can reason modularly about syntactic ambiguity and expansion correctness according to clear criteria. This paper incorporates TLMs into Reason, an emerging alternative front-end for OCaml, and demonstrates, through several non-trivial case studies, how TLMs integrate with the advanced features of OCaml, including pattern matching and the module system. We also discuss optional integration with MetaOCaml, which allows TLM providers to be more confident about type correctness. Finally, we establish these abstract reasoning principles formally with a detailed type-theoretic account of expression and pattern TLMs for “core ML”.},

Poor effort allocation is among the major root causes of rework due to insufficiently resourced early activities. This paper provides results of an empirical study on phase effort distribution data of 75 industry projects, from the China Software Benchmarking Standard Group (CSBSG) database. The phase effort distribution patterns and variation sources are presented, and analysis results show some consistency in effects of software size and team size on code and test phase distribution variations, and some considerable deviations in requirements, design, and transition phases, compared with recommendations in the COCOMO model. Finally, this paper discusses the major findings and threats to validity and presents general guidelines in directing effort allocation. Empirical findings from this study are beneficial for stimulating discussions and debates to improve cost estimation and benchmarking practices.},

	abstract = {Though notoriously difficult, real-time programming offers children a rich new set of applications, and the opportunity to engage bodily knowledge and experience more centrally in intellectual enterprises. Moreover, the seemingly specialized problems of real-time programming can be seen as keys to longstanding difficulties of programming in general. I report on a critical design inquiry into the nature and potential of real-time programming by children. A cyclical process of design, prototyping and testing of computational environments has led to two design innovations: a language in which declarative and procedural descriptions of computation are given equal status, and can subsume each other to arbitrary levels of nesting [and] a "live text" environment, in which real-time display of, and intervention in, program execution are accomplished within the program text itself. Based on children's use of these tools, as well as comparative evidence from other media and domains, I argue that the coordination of discrete and continuous process should be considered a central Big Idea in programming and beyond. In addition, I offer the theoretical notion of the "steady frame" as a way to clarify the user interface requirements of real-time programming, and also to understand the role of programming in learning to construct dynamic models, theories, and representations. Implications for the role of programming in education and for the future of computational literacy are discussed.},

In the teaching of database design, two general approaches are frequently emphasized: top-down and bottom-up. In this paper, we present an empirical comparison of students' performance between these two approaches in a conceptual data modeling exercise. Our results indicate that, while prior database education had a significant effect on the quality of design performance, the chosen approach did not. The findings suggest that database educators should integrate both top-down and bottom-up approaches in database design showing the differences and similarities between the two approaches to improve students' learning of data modeling.},

This highlights the role of these interactions in the situational context, as the design team shape and are shaped by them. Following Dix and Gongora (2011), we identify four overlapping functions: informational, formational, transformational and transcendental. We then examine the emergence of concepts and themes through grouping individual Post-It notes, showing how they might be considered nodes in an emerging semantic network.},

The framework proposed provides a novel, five-dimensional ways in which to consider the concepts, historical and technological background of the methodologies, the characteristic differences between them, the variety of skills, and the economic, technological and organisational conditions needed to execute them. The framework has been formed by combining five techniques of research analysis: Contextual; Historical; Analysis by analogy; Phenomenological; and Linguistic.

              Agile software development is an emerging approach in software engineering, initially proposed and promoted by a group of 17 software professionals who practice a set of “lightweight” methods, and share a common set of values of software development. They consolidated their thoughts, and defined these methods as “agile”. The approaches are based on experiences and best practices from the past by the above‐mentioned group of 17 software professionals. The purpose of this article is to outline the history and evolution of agile software development practices, their principles, and the criticisms as reported by the software development community.

On top of being brought into focus, the manifesto has been widely adopted by developers, in software-developing organizations and outside the world of IT. Agile principles and their implementation in practice have paved the way for radical new and innovative ways of software and product development. In parallel, the understanding of the manifesto’s underlying principles evolved over time. This, in turn, may affect current and future applications of agile principles. This article presents results from a survey and an interview study in collaboration with the original contributors of the manifesto for agile software development. Furthermore, it comprises the results from a workshop with one of the original authors. This publication focuses on the origins of the manifesto, the contributors’ views from today’s perspective, and their outlook on future directions. We evaluated 11 responses from the survey and 14 interviews to understand the viewpoint of the contributors. They emphasize that agile methods need to be carefully selected and agile should not be seen as a silver bullet. They underline the importance of considering the variety of different practices and methods that had an influence on the manifesto. Furthermore, they mention that people should question their current understanding of “agile” and recommend reconsidering the core ideas of the manifesto.},

The paper will predominantly assess the extent to which the Agile software community's use of Kuhn's theory of revolutionary scientific change, particularly in Kent Beck's Extreme Programming (XP), is justified. It will be argued that whereas Kuhn's concepts of "scientific revolutions" and "paradigm shift" can partially explain the large-scale, radical change from "traditional" software methodologies to Agile ones, Popper's critical rationalism seems better suited to the small-scale, piecemeal methodological approach of Agile methodologies. The ethical implications to software engineering of Kuhn's and Popper's theories, as well as the work of the Peopleware authors and the architect, Christopher Alexander, will be discussed. Finally, the ideas of the Frankfurt School will be used to broaden the Popper versus Kuhn debate. A critical reflection on the soundness of applying theories of scientific methodology to the practice of software engineering concludes this paper.},

Refinements to the code completion menu that incorporate additional sources of information have similarly been shown to be valuable, even relative to standalone counterparts offering similar functionality. In this paper, we describe active code completion, an architecture that allows library developers to introduce interactive and highly-specialized code generation interfaces, called palettes, directly into the editor. Using several empirical methods, we examine the contexts in which such a system could be useful, describe the design constraints governing the system architecture as well as particular code completion interfaces, and design one such system, named Graphite, for the Eclipse Java development environment. Using Graphite, we implement a palette for writing regular expressions as our primary example and conduct a small pilot study. In addition to showing the feasibility of this approach, it provides further evidence in support of the claim that integrating specialized code completion interfaces directly into the editor is valuable to professional developers.},

	abstract = {Liquid Haskell is an extension to the Haskell programming language that adds support for refinement types: data types augmented with SMT-decidable logical predicates that refine the set of values that can inhabit a type. Furthermore, Liquid Haskell's support for refinement reflection enables the use of Haskell for general-purpose mechanized theorem proving. A growing list of large-scale mechanized proof developments in Liquid Haskell take advantage of this capability. Adding theorem-proving capabilities to a "legacy" language like Haskell lets programmers directly verify properties of real-world Haskell programs (taking advantage of the existing highly tuned compiler, run-time system, and libraries), just by writing Haskell. However, more established proof assistants like Agda and Coq offer far better support for interactive proof development and insight into the proof state (for instance, what subgoals still need to be proved to finish a partially-complete proof). In contrast, Liquid Haskell provides only coarse-grained feedback to the user -- either it reports a type error, or not -- unfortunately hindering its usability as a theorem prover. In this paper, we propose improving the usability of Liquid Haskell by extending it with support for Agda-style typed holes and interactive editing commands that take advantage of them. In Agda, typed holes allow programmers to indicate unfinished parts of a proof, and incrementally complete the proof in a dialogue with the compiler. While GHC Haskell already has its own Agda-inspired support for typed holes, we posit that typed holes would be especially powerful and useful if combined with Liquid Haskell's refinement types and SMT automation. We discuss how typed holes might work in Liquid Haskell, and we consider possible implementation approaches and next steps.},

	abstract = {Most ideas come from previous ideas. The sixties, particularly in the ARPA community, gave rise to a host of notions about “human-computer symbiosis” through interactive time-shared computers, graphics screens and pointing devices. Advanced computer languages were invented to simulate complex systems such as oil refineries and semi-intelligent behavior. The soon to follow paradigm shift of modern personal computing, overlapping window interfaces, and object-oriented design came from seeing the work of the sixties as something more than a “better old thing”. That is, more than a better way: to do mainframe computing; for end-users to invoke functionality; to make data structures more abstract. Instead the promise of exponential growth in computing/\$/volume   demanded that the sixties be regarded as “
              almost
              a new thing” and to find out what the actual “new things” might be. For example, one would compute with a handheld “Dynabook” in a way that would not be possible on a shared mainframe; millions of potential users meant that the user interface would have to become a learning environment along the lines of Montessori and Bruner; and needs for large scope, reduction in complexity, and end-user literacy would require that data and control structures be done away with in favor of a more biological scheme of protected universal cells interacting only through messages that could mimic any desired behavior.
            
            Early Smalltalk was the first complete realization of these new points of view   as parented by its many predecessors in hardware, language and user interface design. It became the exemplar of the new computing, in part, because we were actually trying for a qualitative shift in belief structures—a new Kuhnian paradigm in the same spirit as the invention of the printing press—and thus took highly extreme positions which almost forced these new styles to be invented.},

	abstract = {Models of attention demonstrated the existence of top-down, bottom-up, and history-driven attentional mechanisms, controlled by partially segregated networks of brain areas. However, few studies have examined the specific deficits in those attentional mechanisms in intellectual disability within the same experimental setting. The aim of the current study was to specify the attentional deficits in intellectual disability in top-down, bottom-up, and history-driven processing of multisensory stimuli, and gain insight into effective attentional cues that could be utilized in cognitive training programs for intellectual disability. The performance of adults with mild to moderate intellectual disability (n = 20) was compared with that of typically developing controls (n = 20) in a virtual reality visual search task. The type of a spatial cue that could aid search performance was manipulated to be either endogenous or exogenous in different sensory modalities (visual, auditory, tactile). The results identified that attentional deficits in intellectual disability are overall more pronounced in top-down rather than in bottom-up processing, but with different magnitudes across cue types: The auditory or tactile endogenous cues were much less effective than the visual endogenous cue in the intellectual disability group. Moreover, the history-driven processing in intellectual disability was altered, such that a reversed priming effect was observed for immediate repetitions of the same cue type. These results suggest that the impact of intellectual disability on attentional processing is specific to attentional mechanisms and cue types, which has theoretical as well as practical implications for developing effective cognitive training programs for the target population.},

	abstract = {Multiple stimuli present in the visual field at the same time compete for neural representation by mutually suppressing their evoked activity throughout visual cortex, providing a neural correlate for the limited processing capacity of the visual system. Competitive interactions among stimuli can be counteracted by top-down, goal-directed mechanisms such as attention, and by bottom-up, stimulus-driven mechanisms. Because these two processes cooperate in everyday life to bias processing toward behaviorally relevant or particularly salient stimuli, it has proven difficult to study interactions between top-down and bottom-up mechanisms. Here, we used an experimental paradigm in which we first isolated the effects of a bottom-up influence on neural competition by parametrically varying the degree of perceptual grouping in displays that were not attended. Second, we probed the effects of directed attention on the competitive interactions induced with the parametric design. We found that the amount of attentional modulation varied linearly with the degree of competition left unresolved by bottom-up processes, such that attentional modulation was greatest when neural competition was little influenced by bottom-up mechanisms and smallest when competition was strongly influenced by bottom-up mechanisms. These findings suggest that the strength of attentional modulation in the visual system is constrained by the degree to which competitive interactions have been resolved by bottom-up processes related to the segmentation of scenes into candidate objects.},

                    Such systems control the airbags in our cars, the flaps of an aircraft, nuclear power plants or pace makers. Software for these systems must be reliable. 
                    Hence, a language and tooling is needed that allows to build and maintain reliable software models. Furthermore, 
                    a reliable compiler is required to obtain decent machine-understandable and executable code from highly abstract models. 
                    This thesis presents SCCharts, a Statecharts-based synchronous and visual modeling language for specifying and designing safety-critical systems and 
                    for deriving their implementations. It elaborates on why a control-flow oriented and synchronous language is desirable and how incremental language 
                    features are chosen to flatten learning curve. It presents an interactive incremental model transformation based compilation approach termed SLIC. 
                    It shows how SLIC helps in supporting both, the modeler and the tool smith for building reliable models and maintaining a reliable compiler, respectively.

Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.},

	abstract = {Forests make up 34.1\% of the Czech Republic total area and forest roads account for nearly the same length (47,465 km) as all other roads administered by the state and its regions (55,738 km). Forest roads are not as intensively used as other roads. On the other hand, as logging trucks carry the maximum permitted load on roads and forests create a specific microclimate, forest roads are subject to rapid wear. A road wearing course is generally designed for 20 years of service and for a maximum damage level of 25\% before they are supposed to be reconstructed. To ensure this life cycle is adhered to, more efficient, faster, and more flexible surface damage detection adaptable for forest environment is needed. As smartphones and their optical devices, i.e., new iPhones with LiDAR sensors, become more advanced, the option arises to perform laser scanning on road surfaces using smartphones applications. This work aimed to test this technology and its precision applicability to assessing damage to a forest wearing course and compare it with another hand-held personal laser scanner (PLShh), represented in this study by GeoSLAM ZEB Horizon scanner, and more precise terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) technology, represented in this study by Faro Focus 3D laser scanner, which have started to replace tacheometric wearing course damage surveying thanks to their greater precision. So, this study involved a comparison of three alternative laser scanning methods focused especially on these, which are implemented in new iPhones for tacheometric surveying. First, a Faro Focus 3D laser scanner was used for the TLS method. Second, the PLShh method was tested on a GeoSLAM ZEB Horizon scanner. Third, another PLShh method using an iPhone 13 Pro with applications 3D Scanner and Polycam was evaluated. If we are comparing positional height accuracy of PLShh to tacheometric surveying on reference cross position height coordinates, ZEB Horizon achieved devXY and devZ RMSE 0.108 m; 0.025 m; iPhone 13 Pro with 3D Scanner app devXY and devZ RMSE 0.185 m; 0.021 m, and with Polycam app devXY and devZ RMSE 0.31 m; 0.045. TLS achieved the best results with devXY RMSE 0.049 and devZ RMSE 0.0077. The results confirm that only the TLS scanner achieves precision values in height differences applicable for an assessment of forest road wearing course damage measurement comparable with tacheometric surveying. Surprisingly, comparing the PLShh scanners to the TLS technology, they achieved interesting results, comparing their transverse profiles and 3D objects as digital surface models (DSM) of the road to TLS in height position. In transverse profiles, ZEB Horizon achieved devZ RMSE 0.032 m; iPhone 13 Pro with 3D Scanner app devZ RMSE 0.017 m, and with Polycam app devZ RMSE 0.041 m compared to the TLS method measured using a Faro Focus 3D static laser scanner. Comparing forest road DSM to Faro Focus 3D, ZEB Horizon achieved devZ RMSE 0.028 m; iPhone 13 Pro with 3D Scanner app devZ RMSE 0.018 m and with Polycam devZ RMSE 0.041 m. These results in height differences show that the height accuracy of PLShh achieves precision, which is applicable to determining the current shape of forest road wearing course compared to the required roof shape gradient. However, further testing provided the insight that such a kind of PLShh measurement is still only possible to use for the identification of a transverse profile shape, as in length measurement the length error increases. All PLShh are able to capture the current shape of forest road cross profile, but still they cannot be used for any design or calculation of material measurement needed for wearing course repair.},

In this paper, we identify a set of constraints on statecharts that ensure that the fixpoint, Statemate and UML semantics coincide, if observations are restricted to linear, stuttering-closed, separable properties. Moreover, we show that for a subset of these constraints, a slight variation of the Statemate semantics coincides for linear stuttering-closed properties with the UML semantics.},

In recent years the way to represent a task plan to control an autonomous agent has been shifting from the standard FSM towards BTs. Many works in the literature have highlighted and proven the beneﬁts of such design compared to standard approaches, especially in terms of modularity, reactivity and human readability. However, these works have often failed in providing a tangible comparison in the implementation of those policies and the programming effort required to modify them. This is a relevant aspect in many robotic applications, where the design choice is dictated both by the robustness of the policy and by the time required to program it. In this work, we compare backward chained BTs with a fault-tolerant design of FSMs by evaluating the cost to modify them. We validate the analysis with a set of experiments in a simulation environment where a mobile manipulator solves an item fetching task.},

Ammar Computer Science and Electrical Engineering Department West Virginia University, Morgantown West Virginia, WV26506 INTRODUCTION Finite state machines and their extension to statecharts are widely used in reactive systems. David Harel [Harel87] has introduced statecharts as an extension of finite state machines to describe the complex behavior of an entity. The formalized concepts of statecharts and their specifications have been used in many applications. Here, we show how to solve recurring design problems in implementing statechart specification of an entity in an object-oriented application. The statecharts' patterns represent solutions to frequent design problems that are commonly thought of by system designers, which include how to deploy hierarchy, orthogonality, and broadcasting in a statechart's object oriented design. Since statecharts are frequently applicable to software applications, thus it is helpful for the system designer to directly exercise the statechart pattern language in his application design. In the next section, a quick background of statechart is presented, then a pattern map summarizes the statechart patterns and their relation to finite state machine patterns. The rest of the sections describe the patterns themselves.},

The hope was that providing an explicit section for enforcing explicitly the coordinated systemic behavior could bring beneﬁts to subsequent modelling and implementation phases. The paper presents recent research results, which go beyond the original improvements observed in software quality factors. It can in fact be shown that Part-Whole Statecharts have a computable semantics, which can be speciﬁed through a constraint-driven speciﬁcation method. Such a method allows to enforce the intended coordination of component state machines directly at design time through propositional logic.},

This proposition captures all the logical constraints imposed by the diagram on the Statechart’s semantics, i.e., the possible sets of transitions that can be taken together to perform a valid Statecharts step, and their effects on Statecharts conﬁgurations. The paper’s main result shows that the correct semantics is uniquely described by the intuitionistic interpretation of Statecharts formulas, whereas the naive classical interpretation is insufﬁcient. The advocated intuitionistic approach not only gives a correct, clear and direct logical account of Statecharts’ semantics, but also permits the integration of Statecharts with formal validation tools, such as theorem provers.},

Two of the main differences are: (i) in Rhapsody, changes made in a given step are to take effect in the current step and not in the next step; (ii) in Rhapsody, a step can take more than zero time. This paper constitutes the first description of the executable semantics of Rhapsody, highlighting the differences from the Statemate semantics and making an effort to explain the issues clearly but rigorously, including the motivation for some of the design decisions taken.},

We review the Hierarchical Timed Automata model which provides already the most fundamental concepts for structure and time as well as a reasonable semantics for the domain of temporal behavior. To enable the modeling of complex control behavior which incorporates most of the fundamental extensions for expressiveness and time in a manner appropriate for real-time systems, we then propose an extension in form of Extended Hierarchical Timed Automata and Real-Time Statecharts.

	abstract = {We present the DOOP framework for points-to analysis of Java programs. DOOP builds on the idea of specifying pointer analysis algorithms declaratively, using Datalog: a logic-based language for defining (recursive) relations. We carry the declarative approach further than past work by describing the full end-to-end analysis in Datalog and optimizing aggressively using a novel technique specifically targeting highly recursive Datalog programs. As a result, DOOP achieves several benefits, including full order-of-magnitude improvements in runtime. We compare DOOP with Lhotak and Hendren's PADDLE, which defines the state of the art for context-sensitive analyses. For the exact same logical points-to definitions (and, consequently, identical precision) DOOP is more than 15x faster than PADDLE for a 1-call-site sensitive analysis of the DaCapo benchmarks, with lower but still substantial speedups for other important analyses. Additionally, DOOP scales to very precise analyses that are impossible with PADDLE and Whaley et al.'s bddbddb, directly addressing open problems in past literature. Finally, our implementation is modular and can be easily configured to analyses with a wide range of characteristics, largely due to its declarativeness.},

Using a convergent, parallel, mixed methods design, this study evaluated the TIC approach that a bachelor’s of social work program used at the start of COVID-19 during spring of 2020. A survey measured the extent to which students believed the program exhibited TIC. Focus groups explored how the students benefited from the program’s TIC response. Descriptive results showed that the pro­ gram scored highly in the TIC approach in the following domains: cultural responsiveness and inclusivity (M=2.9; SD=0.07), environment of agency and mutual respect (M=2.83; SD=0.11), and emphasis on strengths (M=2.79; SD=0.05). Qualitative themes were (a) the program’s swift and proactive response fostered a sense of safety, (b) the program encouraged students’ empowerment and autonomy, and (c) the program created opportunities for human connection and support. Programs should consider TIC as an option to support students during and post-COVID-19.},

Second, to understand our results, we drew lessons from the social sciences. We found surprising connections from seemingly unrelated studies such as on why older Americans listen to country music and Mormons do not drink coffee.

	url = {https://publikationen.uni-tuebingen.de/xmlui/handle/10900/102021},
	abstract = {An important aspect of software development is to structure the control flow of a 
program. Features to structure the control flow range from simple branching between 
two possible execution paths, to non-local control-flow transfers 
by means of jumps or exceptions. Furthermore, modern programming languages 
offer advanced control-flow structures like async/await to avoid blocking 
when performing input / output actions, generators to model demand driven 
computation of streams, or coroutines to express control-flow transfer between 
different software components. 
Often, those advanced control-flow abstractions are built into the language and are thus 
not user definable. Users are thus limited to the control-flow 
features provided by the programming language designers and cannot create 
their own custom domain-specific control-flow abstractions. 
 
Another aspect of software development is to parametrize a software 
component over details that might vary. 
Parametrizing a component with configuration, behavior, or other 
components, enables reuse of the same component in different contexts. 
Components can be configured statically, or dynamically at runtime. 
Manually parametrizing components can quickly become tedious, both for the 
component author who needs to design the component for parametrization, as well 
as the user of the component who needs to provide all parameters. This is 
especially the case for components that depend on other parametrized components. 
They often need to be parametrized by all transitive parameters of their 
dependencies. 
 
Algebraic effects (Plotkin and Power, 2003) and their extension with handlers 
(Plotkin and Pretnar, 2009, 2013) offer interesting new ways to 
structure programs. Programs use effect operations, which, like normal 
functions, can receive arguments and return results. However, the implementation 
of effect operations is left open and depends on the context in which the program is 
executed. 
Effect handlers, much like exception handlers, handle effect 
operations and provide their implementation. Like throwing an exception, 
calling an effect operation transfers control to the corresponding handler. 
Unlike exceptions, the handler can resume the computation and thus transfer 
control back to the call site. 
Effect handlers support both aspects of software development 
concisely: they can express advanced control-flow structures as well as parametrization of 
software components. 
It has been shown in the literature that effect handlers can 
express many of the aforementioned control-flow structures as libraries, such as 
async/await, generators, and coroutines. At the same time, 
effect operations can conveniently be used to parametrize software components 
while handlers provide the configuration. Unifying both aspects also guarantees 
well-defined interaction between control flow and parametrization. 
 
While algebraic effects recently gained popularity in the programming language 
research community, we identify two problems hindering adoption by a wider 
audience of programmers. Firstly, programmers are immediately 
confronted with the full generality of effect handlers. While effect handlers 
are expressive enough to model advanced control-flow structures, not all 
use cases require this expressivity. 
Secondly, algebraic effects and handlers have been conceived in the realm of 
functional programming languages. In consequence, most implementations of effect handlers 
are either standalone languages following the functional programming paradigm or 
are library embeddings into existing functional programming languages. 
 
In this thesis, we propose solutions to the two aforementioned problems 
with the goal to facilitate adoption of effect handlers by a wider audience. 
 
To address the first problem, we systematically present effect handlers as a 
combination of delimited control (that is, they allow control-flow transfers) 
and dynamic binding (that is, they allow parametrization). While the connection 
between effect handlers and delimited control has previously been established 
and it has been shown that effect handlers can express dynamic binding, we 
discover that dynamic binding and effect handlers form a spectrum. 
We present a language 
design that embraces this spectrum. Increasing 
expressivity and conceptual complexity step-by-step, we introduce the three 
features ambient values, ambient functions, and ambient control. Ambient 
values coincide with dynamically bound variables and ambient control 
coincides with a slightly restricted form of effect handlers. The novel 
intermediate form of ambient functions enables abstraction similar to 
effect handlers, but without modifying the control flow: Ambient functions 
are dynamically bound, but statically evaluated. Introducing effect 
handlers from dynamic binding offers programmers an alternative way to approach 
handlers. They can incrementally learn and understand the different 
generalizations (ambient values, functions, and control). We hope this 
facilitates adoption of effect handlers by a wider audience. 
 
To address the second problem, we present a library design, which embeds effect 
handlers in object-oriented programming languages. Our design embraces the 
object-oriented programming paradigm and we map abstractions of effect 
handlers to key abstractions of object-oriented programming. Combining the 
two paradigms not only enables programmers to use effect handlers in object-oriented 
programs, but also to use object-oriented programming abstractions to modularize 
effect handlers. 
Our design employs explicit capability-passing style. That is, instead 
of dynamically searching for a handler at runtime, we pass instances of handlers 
as additional arguments to methods. 
We present an implementation of our library design in the language Scala. 
It is based on a variation of a continuation monad for multi-prompt delimited 
control (Dybvig et al., 2007) to allow effect handlers to express advanced control-flow structures. 
We study the extensibility properties gained by embedding effect handlers 
into an object-oriented programming language. 
While it opens up new dimensions of extensibility, the implementation still 
comes with two limitations. Firstly, being based on a monad 
user programs have to be written in monadic style. Secondly, the implementation 
is not effect safe and capabilities can escape the scope of their handler. 
This potentially results in runtime errors. 
We separately address the two limitations. 
Firstly, we present an implementation in Java that performs a type-selective 
continuation-passing style transformation by rewriting of bytecode. This way, 
user programs in the Java implementation can be written in direct-style 
overcoming the limitation of the Scala implementation. 
Secondly, we enhance our Scala library with an embedded effect system. We index 
the type of effectful programs with an intersection type to track the set of 
used effects. Expressing the set of used effects as an intersection type allows 
us to reuse Scala's support for subtyping to express effect subtyping and to 
reuse Scala's support for type polymorphism to express effect polymorphism.},

Notations based on state machines, such as, Statecharts, Requirements State Machine Language (RSML), and SCR, are suitable for modeling of embedded systems and eliminate many of the main drawbacks of formal specification languages. Although a specification language can help eliminate accidental complexity, the inherent complexity of many of today’s systems inevitably leads to large and complex specifications. Thus, there is a need for mechanisms to simplify a formal specification and present information to analysts and reviewers in digestible chunks. In this paper, we present a two tiered approach to slicing (or simplification) of hierarchical finite state machines. We allow an analyst to simplify a specification based on a scenario. The remaining behavior, called an interpretation of the specification, can then be sliced to extract the information effecting selected variables and transitions. To evaluate the effectiveness and utility of slicing in hierarchical state machines, we have implemented a prototype tool and applied our slicing approach to parts of a specification of a large avionics system called TCAS II (Traffic alert and Collision Avoidance System II).},

The framework can also incorporate checks that go beyond the expressiveness of OCL by implementing them directly in Java, which can also serve as a gateway to formal verification tools; we have exploited this to incorporate a theorem prover for more advanced checks. As a case study, we have adopted the UML well-formedness rules; this confirms that individual rules are easily incorporated into the framework. 1},

	abstract = {This paper presents an algorithm for automatically generating UML statecharts from a collection of UML sequence diagrams. Computer support for this transition between requirements and design is important for a successful application of UML's highly iterative, distributed software development process. There are three main issues which must be addressed when generating statecharts from sequence diagrams. Firstly, conflicts arising from the merging of independently developed sequence diagrams must be detected and resolved. Secondly, different sequence diagrams often contain identical or similar behaviors. For a true interleaving of the sequence diagrams, these behaviors must be recognized and merged. Finally, generated statecharts usually are only an approximation of the system and thus must be hand-modified and refined by designers. As such, the generated artifact should be highly structured and readable. In terms of statecharts, this corresponds to the introduction of hierarchy. Our algorithm successfully tackles all three of these aspects and will be illustrated in this paper with a well-known ATM example.},

STATEMATE is a graphical working environment, intended for the specification, analysis, design and documentation of large and complex reactive systems, such as real-time embedded systems, control and communication systems, and interactive software. It enables a user to prepare, analyze and debug diagrammatic, yet precise, descriptions of the system under development from three inter-related points of view, capturing, structure, functionality and behavior. These views are represented by three graphical languages, the most intricate of which is the language of statecharts used to depict reactive behavior over time. In addition to the use of statecharts, the main novelty of STATEMATE is in the fact that it ‘understands’ the entire descriptions perfectly, to the point of being able to analyze them for crucial dynamic properties, to carry out rigorous animated executions and simulations of the described system, and to create running code automatically. These features are invaluable when it comes to the quality and reliability of the final outcome.},

Four specific areas for future research are proposed: 1) a more in-depth understanding of selfevaluative mechanisms during flow, and the relevance of clear goals and feedback within creative domains; 2) whether flow during deliberate forms of creativity is possible and whether this contradicts hypofrontality theories; 3) the complex relationship between creativity, affect, and flow; and 4) whether and how flow relates to creative achievement.},

Positive affect often – but inconsistently – facilitates creativity, and both may be linked to experiencing flow. This study aimed to determine relationships between these variables within visual creativity. Participants performed the creative mental synthesis task to simulate the creative process. Affect change (pre- vs. post-task) and flow were measured via questionnaires. The creativity of synthesis drawings was rated objectively and subjectively by judges. Findings empirically demonstrate that flow is related to affect improvement during visual creativity. Affect change was linked to productivity and selfrated creativity, but no other objective or subjective performance measures. Flow was unrelated to all external performance measures, but was highly correlated with self-rated creativity; flow may therefore motivate perseverance toward eventual excellence rather than provide direct cognitive enhancement.},

This article examines a group composition task to study the relationships between creativity, flow and the quality of the compositions produced. First-year university students ( n = 45) worked on a group composition task during three meetings. Each time the students met, they completed a detailed questionnaire that assessed aspects of each student's experience of the group compositional process using an ‘experience sampling form’ based on Csikszentmihalyi's previous work. Completed compositions were recorded and rated for quality and creativity by the participants and by a group of music education specialists ( n= 24). Results indicated a number of ways in which the specialists’ assessments of quality related to the students’ assessments of creativity and flow. The study provides an example of a research method that can be used to further our understanding of the processes and outcomes of group music composition tasks. The discussion also considers a number of important ways that the concept of flow can be utilized within a music education context.},

Such behaviors can lead to significant public health problems of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity, liver disease, and hypertension, yet some individuals do not appear to suffer negative consequences but rather bounce back. OBJECTIVE: To pilot the feasibility and potential efficacy of the Empower Resilience Intervention to build capacity by increasing resilience and health behaviors and decreasing symptoms and negative health behaviors with young adults in an educational setting who have had ACEs. DESIGN: A two-group pre–post repeated measures design to compare symptoms, health behaviors, and resilience and written participant responses. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant cohort by time interaction for physical activity in the intervention group. There was no significant change in risk behaviors or resilience score by cohort. Young adults in the intervention group reported building strengths, reframing resilience, and creating support connections. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in health behavior is theoretically consistent with this strengths-based intervention. Evaluating this intervention with a larger sample is important. Interrupting the ACE to illness trajectory is complex. This short-term empower resilience intervention, however, holds promise as an opportunity to reconsider the negative effects of the trauma of the past and build on strengths to develop a preferred future.},

	abstract = {Objective:
              While everyone—including front-line clinicians—should strive to prevent the maltreatment and other severe stresses experienced by many children and adults in everyday life, psychiatrists and other health professionals also need to consider how best to support, throughout the lifespan, those people affected by severe adversity. The first step in achieving this is a clear understanding of the definitions and concepts in the rapidly growing study of resilience. Our paper reviews the definitions of resilience and the range of factors understood as contributing to it, and considers some of the implications for clinical care and public health.
            
            
              Method:
              This narrative review took a major Canadian report published in 2006 as its starting point. The databases, MEDLINE and PsycINFO, were searched for new relevant citations from 2006 up to July 2010 to identify key papers considering the definitions of resilience and related concepts.
            
            
              Results:
              Definitions have evolved over time but fundamentally resilience is understood as referring to positive adaptation, or the ability to maintain or regain mental health, despite experiencing adversity. The personal, biological, and environmental or systemic sources of resilience and their interaction are considered. An interactive model of resilience illustrates the factors that enhance or reduce homeostasis or resilience.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              The 2 key concepts for clinical and public health work are: the dynamic nature of resilience throughout the lifespan; and the interaction of resilience in different ways with major domains of life function, including intimate relationships and attachments.},

	abstract = {Objective:
              Child maltreatment is linked with numerous adverse outcomes that can continue throughout the lifespan. However, variability of impairment has been noted following child maltreatment, making it seem that some people are more resilient. Our review includes a brief discussion of how resilience is measured in child maltreatment research; a summary of the evidence for protective factors associated with resilience based on those studies of highest quality; a discussion of how knowledge of protective factors can be applied to promote resilience among people exposed to child maltreatment; and finally, directions for future research.
            
            
              Method:
              The databases MEDLINE and PsycINFO were searched for relevant citations up to July 2010 to identify key studies and evidence syntheses.
            
            
              Results:
              Although comparability across studies is limited, family-level factors of stable family environment and supportive relationships appear to be consistently linked with resilience across studies. There was also evidence for some individual-level factors, such as personality traits, although proxies of intellect were not as strongly related to resilience following child maltreatment.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              Findings from resilience research needs to be applied to determine effective strategies and specific interventions to promote resilience and foster well-being among maltreated children.},

However, less is known about how collective-action outcomes (i.e., success and failure) shape engagement in social movements over time. Using data collected before and after the 2017 marriage-equality debate in Australia, we conducted a latent profile analysis that indicated that success unified supporters of change ( n = 420), whereas failure created subgroups among opponents ( n = 419), reflecting four divergent responses: disengagement (resigned acceptors), moderate disengagement and continued investment (moderates), and renewed commitment to the cause using similar strategies (stay-the-course opponents) or new strategies (innovators). Resigned acceptors were least inclined to act following failure, whereas innovators were generally more likely to engage in conventional action and justify using radical action relative to the other profiles. These divergent reactions were predicted by differing baseline levels of social identification, group efficacy, and anger. Collective-action outcomes dynamically shape participation in social movements; this is an important direction for future research.},

It conceptualizes collective action as the outcome of two distinct processes: emotion-focused and problem-focused approach coping. The former revolves around the experience of group-based anger (based in appraised external blame for unfair collective disadvantage). The latter revolves around beliefs in the group’s efficacy (based in appraised instrumental coping potential for social change). The model is the first to make explicit the dynamic nature of collective action by explaining how undertaking collective action leads to the reappraisal of collective disadvantage, thus inspiring future collective action. The authors review empirical support for the model, discuss its theoretical and practical implications, and identify directions for future research and application.},

Decisions and tradeoffs made by the language designer at this level (single vs. multiple inheritance, mixins vs. Traits, dynamic dispatch vs. static case analysis, etc.) cannot be repaired easily by the programmer when they prove inconvenient or inadequate. The artiﬁcial distinction between implementation language and end-user language can be eliminated by implementing the language using only end-user objects and messages, making the implementation accessible for arbitrary modiﬁcation by programmers. We show that three object types and ﬁve methods are sufﬁcient to bootstrap an extensible object model and messaging semantics that are described entirely in terms of those same objects and messages. Raising the implementation to the programmers’ level lets them design and control their own implementation mechanisms in which to express concise solutions and frees the original language designer from ever having to say “I’m sorry”.},

A major difficulty is the huge gap between these two disciplines being the reason for this missing interdisciplinary thinking. Developing software is way too often reduced to the act of entering commands in a way the computer does what
the programmer wants it to do. In reality a lot of steps happen until software developers can express their ideas in such a clarity that they are able to create an executable and correct program. Looking at the software development process holistically and applying ideas of cognitive psychology, especially the ones of mental models, the author of this thesis tries to align the thought process behind creating software closer with the actual technical process of doing it. This leads to the research question: Which findings of cognitive and social psychology support the usage of statecharts combined with hole-driven development for enabling better communication in software development processes, or how can these concepts be adapted to closer align to the way the human brain works?},

This decomposition allows us to identify hierarchical finite state machines (HFSMs) equivalent to a given finite state machine (FSM). We provide a definition of a module in an FSM, which is a collection of nodes which can be treated as a nested FSM. We identify a well-behaved subset of FSM modules called thin modules, and represent these using a linear-space directed graph we call a decomposition tree. We prove that every FSM has a unique decomposition tree which uniquely stores each thin module. We provide an \$O(n{\textasciicircum}2k)\$ algorithm for finding the decomposition tree of an \$n\$-state \$k\$-alphabet FSM. The decomposition tree allows us to extend FSMs to equivalent HFSMs. For thin HFSMs, which are those where each nested FSM is a thin module, we can construct an equivalent maximally-hierarchical HFSM in polynomial time.},

In doing so, they can dynamically combine individual services to their service applications. However, unless the data on the Web can be meaningfully shared and is interpretable, this objective cannot be realised. It is believed that the vision of the Web can only be realised through proliferation of well-known ontologies describing diﬀerent domains. Ontologies, as a foundation of service applications, is investigated in the paper. In order to cope with the distributed computing across a wide range of domains from e-economy to e-science and e-government, agent technologies are applied to deal with service agents’ on and oﬀ and to provide semantic support for implementation of complex e-business applications. Finite state machines (FSM) have been examined to facilitate process automation. Our approach targets at dynamic information sharing and reuse in e-business applications. Finally, our ontological approach is illustrated by employing FSM agents in a Web environment.},

	abstract = {Digital systems are becoming very large and complex making the process of ﬁnding bugs and design validation in early stages of the design cycle a must. As a contribution towards catching this goal, we propose an approach to interface Abstract State Machines (ASM) with Multiway Decision Graphs (MDG) to enable tool support for the formal veriﬁcation of ASM descriptions. ASM is a speciﬁcation method for software and hardware providing a powerful means of modeling various kinds of systems. MDGs are decision diagrams based on abstract representation of data and are mainly used for modeling hardware systems. Both ASM and MDG are based on a subset of many-sorted ﬁrst order logic, making it appealing to link these two concepts. We implemented a transformation tool that automatically generates MDG models from ASM speciﬁcations, then formal veriﬁcation techniques provided by the MDG tool, such as model checking or equivalence checking, can be applied on the generated models.We consider both structural and behavioral models of hardware in our implementation. We have applied this transformation schema on some examples and case studies where our tool generates the corresponding MDG-HDL models automatically.},

	abstract = {Context and motivation] Usage of Formal Speciﬁcation languages is scarce in web application development as compared to safety critical/hardware systems. [Question/problem] An apt formal speciﬁcation language should provide the following features: Firstly, it should have well-deﬁned semantics, so that speciﬁcations written in it can not be inherently ambiguous. Secondly, it should have tool support for automatic detection of speciﬁcation bugs. Additionally, for domains like web development, it is important that speciﬁcation formalisms build over familiar notations, as the beneﬁts of learning highly mathematical notations in such domains are perceived to be low. [Principal ideas/results] This work presents a State Based Language inspired by Statecharts called StaBL for speciﬁcation of web applications, and how StaBL can be used for writing such speciﬁcations. We also present modiﬁcations to the language w.r.t Statechart which facilitate writing modular and scalable speciﬁcation. [Contribution] In particular, we present the feature of locally scoped variables with inter-state data-ﬂow. We summarise our experience of developing speciﬁcations with StaBL, which shows that StaBL speciﬁcations, on the one hand, are able to capture most essential elements of the functional aspects of a web application while foregoing much of the verbosity of a regular programming language.},

A model of the mode logic of a Flight Guidance System was specified in the RSML-e notation and translated into the NuSMV model checker and the PVS theorem prover. These tools were then used to verify several hundred properties of the RSML-e model. In the process, several errors were discovered and corrected in the original model. This demonstrates that formal requirements models can be written for real problems and that formal analysis tools have matured to the point where they can be used to find errors before implementation. It also points out a clear relationship between requirements stated informally as “shalls”, formal properties, and requirements models.},

We structure the components into features, which represent reusable, self-contained services. These are modeled individually by statechart diagrams. For composition of components from features, we need to consider the interactions between the features. These feature interactions, well known in the telecommunications area, typically describe special cases or cooperations which only occur when two features are combined. We describe these interactions graphically by reﬁnement relations between statecharts. The main novelty is that full component descriptions are created in a plug-andplay fashion by combining the statecharts for the required features and interactions. Furthermore, we develop different classes of statecharts and show the interactions on a case-by-case basis. For composition, we use semantic reﬁnement concepts for statecharts which preserve the original behavior.},

	abstract = {We present a denotational, strictly syntax-directed, semantics for Statecharts, a graphical, mixed specification/programming language for real-time, developed by Harel [HI. This requires first of all defining a proper syntax for the graphical language. Apart from more conventional syntactical operators and their semantic counterparts, we encounter unconventional ones, dealing with the typical graphical structure of the language. The synchronous nature of Statecharts makes special demands on the semantics, especially with respect to the causal relation between simultaneous events, and requires a refinement of our techniques for obtaining a denotational semantics for OCCAM [HGR]. We prove that the model is fully abstract with respect to some natural notion of observable behaviour. The model presented will serve as a basis for a further study of specification and proof systems within the ESPRIT-project DESCARTES.},

	abstract = {Background. In order to understand research on a particular computing topic, practitioners and researchers often need to obtain an overview of its research methods. Current research methods coding schemes either capture insufﬁcient details to support a full critical assessment, or are specialised to a particular research type. Aim. This paper deﬁnes and demonstrates RSML, a Research Schema Modelling Language that captures a high level of detail and is applicable to most types of computing research. Method. RSML was designed using concepts from the research methods literature, then reﬁned inductively. An RSML editor was created to assist coders and help reduce coding errors. To demonstrate the feasibility of modelling research with RSML, and to exemplify the summary information that can be derived from a database of RSML encodings, a trial review of 24 articles from one journal was conducted. Results. The review illustrates quantitatively the journal’s focus on artifact construction and empiricism. It also reveals that observations are rarely used to inform artifact construction, and purely empirical studies are scarce. Conclusion. RSML can be used to model sophisticated, multifaceted research spanning a wide range of software engineering topics, yielding insights that are not easily captured by current coding schemes.},

Designing composition languages is a challenge itself as both practical applicability (support for different composition approaches in various application domains), and precise formal semantics (support for veriﬁcation and code generation) have to be taken into account. In our Gamma Statechart Composition Framework, we designed and implemented a composition language for the synchronous, cascade synchronous and asynchronous composition of statechartbased reactive components. We formalized the semantics of this composition language that provides the basis for generating composition-related Java source code as well as mapping the composite system to a back-end model checker for formal veriﬁcation and model-based test case generation. In this paper, we present the composition language with its formal semantics, putting special emphasis on design decisions related to the language and their effects on veriﬁability and applicability. Furthermore, we demonstrate the design and veriﬁcation functionality of the composition framework by presenting case studies from the cyber-physical system domain.},

Our Match operator is heuristic, making use of both static and behavioural properties of the models to improve the accuracy of matching. Our Merge operator preserves the hierarchical structure of the input models, and handles differences in behaviour through parameterization. In this way, we automatically construct merges that preserve the semantics of Statecharts models. We illustrate and evaluate our work by applying our operators to AT\&T telecommunication features.},

	abstract = {Over the past few years, the popularity of social media influencers (SMIs) has been growing exponentially, making influencer marketing (IM) prevalent in firm strategies. Despite the mounting interest of researchers and practitioners, the resulting scholarly work remains divergent, partial and fragmented. In light of the pivotal role of SMIs on the consumer decision journey and as this research domain is still developing, a comprehensive and critical overview of extant research on this topic is sorely needed. In response, this paper is the first to consolidate the present state of research on IM within social media settings. More specifically, a systematic review of relevant studies published in peer-reviewed academic journals across diverse fields was conducted in order to identify key themes and dominant concepts. The analysis of 68 articles from 29 Chartered Association of Business Schools-ranked journals forges a robust understanding of this phenomenon, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying the appeal of SMIs and their influential power in shaping consumer attitudes and behaviour. Based on the analysis, an integrative multidimensional framework is presented that considers antecedents, mediators and moderators of potential outcomes, as well as contextual factors that translate into consumer behaviour. In so doing, various research gaps are identified and avenues for future research are proposed that reflect important emerging areas and unexplored realms with reference to theory, context and methodology. Conclusively, implications of this study for theory and practice are discussed.},

To understand consumers’ behavioral intentions when they encounter product rec­ ommendations from fashion influencers on Instagram, this study addresses the congruence among the three inherent contributors to any influencer marketing campaign: the influencer, the consumer (or follower), and the sponsored brand. The study involves 372 followers of a famous fashion influencer. Results confirm that when influencer–consumer congruence is fixed and high, high (low) influencer–product congruence prompts high (low) consumer–product congruence. Strong congruence between the consumer and product then generates more favorable attitudes toward the product, as well as higher purchase and recommendation intentions, ensuring optimal returns on influencer marketing campaigns.},

	abstract = {Background: Eating disorders among adolescents are an ongoing public health concern. Sustainable health promotion programmes require a thorough understanding of the social context in which minors engage. Initial studies show that young people make extensive use of social networks in order to exchange experiences and gather information. During this process their (buying) behaviour is significantly affected by so-called influencers.
Methods: The exploratory research studies non-campaign driven health communication on dieting and exercise by influencers in social networks with a focus on content, techniques and visible impact. In a mixed methods approach, we initially analysed 1000 posts from influencers on Instagram quantitatively. Subsequently we conducted an in-depth content analysis of 9 extreme and 27 typical communication threads.
Results: Influencers gain the trust and friendship of their followers by designing body-shape focused visual content and targeted communication techniques. They identify and define diet and exercise as factors to be controlled for body perfection. By consuming dietary supplements and wearing tight-fitting branded sportswear, influencers promise a simplified way of optimizing one’s appearance as the key to happiness. Direct and surreptitious advertising of industry-specific products constitutes the communicative focus. At the same time, minors identify with the roles and ideals demonstrated by influencers and their needs are satisfied on several different levels. This creates a relationship of dependency between influencers and their followers.
Conclusions: The dynamics in the field of health communication by influencers on social networks will become increasingly important in the coming years. This is largely due to the targeted demand on the part of (mainly) underage users and the high attractiveness of influencer marketing on the part of companies. Influencers suggest a dependence on happiness, well-being, health and beauty. Only those who create a body shaped through control and discipline are healthy and beautiful - and can be happy. The indirectly communicated conclusions, which can be considered as extremely critical, illustrate the need for action in order to protect and positively accompany young people in their psychological and physical development. The shift of authority figures within Generation Z, as well as identified communication techniques, can be considered and may be harnessed by targeted, group-oriented campaign designs.},

	abstract = {Watching online videos is becoming an important part of children’s media diets. Children particularly like content that is speciﬁcally created for YouTube by YouTube personalities. Because these personalities have a large reach and are considered likeable and credible, they have become social media inﬂuencers. For advertisers, these inﬂuencers are an interesting channel to reach youth. Therefore, inﬂuencers often embed persuasive sponsored messages in their videos to earn money. However, there are concerns about this practice because it is not always clear when a video includes advertising. Therefore, in several countries, guidelines have been developed that state that sponsoring in inﬂuencer videos should be disclosed as such. Until now, little is known about the effects of disclosures for inﬂuencer videos on children and the boundary conditions for such effects. Therefore, we investigated the effects of a disclosure of sponsored inﬂuencer videos on children’s advertising literacy. Additionally, we examined the consequences of the disclosure for children’s responses to the brand, advertised product, and video. We also included the para-social relationship (PSR) that children experience with an inﬂuencer as a possible boundary condition for disclosure effects on persuasion. Our experiment amongst children between 8 and 12 years old showed that, when children correctly recalled the disclosure, the disclosure increased their recognition of advertising, and understanding of selling and persuasive intent. Moreover, advertising literacy evoked by the disclosure affected persuasion: The disclosure enhanced brand memory through ad recognition, but also decreased advertised product desire through understanding the selling intent of the video. Furthermore, the PSR of children with the inﬂuencer proved to be a boundary condition for disclosure effects on brand attitudes. Only for those children who experienced moderate to low PSRs with the inﬂuencer, the disclosure resulted in less positive brand attitudes through understanding selling intent. For children who experienced a strong PSR with the inﬂuencer, the understanding that the content had a selling intent did not affect their brand attitudes. These ﬁndings show that a disclosure (if noticed and remembered) can be an effective tool to achieve transparency, but also inﬂuences the persuasive outcomes of inﬂuencer marketing in online videos.},

	abstract = {Children nowadays spend many hours online watching YouTube videos in which their favorite vloggers are playing games, unboxing toys, reviewing products, making jokes or just going about their daily activities. These vloggers regularly post attractive and entertaining content in the hope of building a large follower base. Although many of these vloggers are adults, the number of child vloggers is flourishing. The famous child vlogger Ryan of Ryan’s World, for instance, has more than 19 million viewers and he is (at age seven) a social media influencer. The popularity of these vloggers incited advertisers to include them as a new marketing communication tool, also referred to as influencer marketing, in their marketing strategy. Accordingly, many influential vloggers now receive free products from brands in return for a mention in one of their videos and their other social media (e.g., TikTok or Instagram) and some are even paid to create a sponsored post or video and distribute it to their followers. This sponsored content appears to be highly influential and may affect young children’s brand preferences. Given the limited advertising literacy skills (i.e., knowledge of advertising and skills to critically reflect on this advertising) of children under age 12, they are a vulnerable target group when it comes to persuasion. Therefore, caution is needed when implementing this marketing tactic to target them. However, research on how influencer marketing affects young children (under 12) is scarce and it is unclear how these young children can be empowered to critically cope with this fairly new form of persuasion. This paper therefore aims to shed light on why and how social media influencers have persuasive power over their young followers. The paper starts with providing insights into how and why social media influencers became a new source in advertising. We then discuss the few studies that have been conducted on influencer marketing among young children (under 12), based on a systematic literature review, and take these findings to formulate societal and policy implications and develop a future research agenda.},

	abstract = {Objectives
              To systematically examine the evidence of harms and benefits relating to time spent on screens for children and young people’s (CYP) health and well-being, to inform policy.
            
            
              Methods
              Systematic review of reviews undertaken to answer the question ‘What is the evidence for health and well-being effects of screentime in children and adolescents (CYP)?’ Electronic databases were searched for systematic reviews in February 2018. Eligible reviews reported associations between time on screens (screentime; any type) and any health/well-being outcome in CYP. Quality of reviews was assessed and strength of evidence across reviews evaluated.
            
            
              Results
              13 reviews were identified (1 high quality, 9 medium and 3 low quality). 6 addressed body composition; 3 diet/energy intake; 7 mental health; 4 cardiovascular risk; 4 for fitness; 3 for sleep; 1 pain; 1 asthma. We found moderately strong evidence for associations between screentime and greater obesity/adiposity and higher depressive symptoms; moderate evidence for an association between screentime and higher energy intake, less healthy diet quality and poorer quality of life. There was weak evidence for associations of screentime with behaviour problems, anxiety, hyperactivity and inattention, poorer self-esteem, poorer well-being and poorer psychosocial health, metabolic syndrome, poorer cardiorespiratory fitness, poorer cognitive development and lower educational attainments and poor sleep outcomes. There was no or insufficient evidence for an association of screentime with eating disorders or suicidal ideation, individual cardiovascular risk factors, asthma prevalence or pain. Evidence for threshold effects was weak. We found weak evidence that small amounts of daily screen use is not harmful and may have some benefits.
            
            
              Conclusions
              There is evidence that higher levels of screentime is associated with a variety of health harms for CYP, with evidence strongest for adiposity, unhealthy diet, depressive symptoms and quality of life. Evidence to guide policy on safe CYP screentime exposure is limited.

However, highly accurate image contour detection algorithms are also very computationally intensive, which limits their applicability, even for ofﬂine batch processing. In this work, we examine efﬁcient parallel algorithms for performing image contour detection, with particular attention paid to local image analysis as well as the generalized eigensolver used in Normalized Cuts. Combining these algorithms into a contour detector, along with careful implementation on highly parallel, commodity processors from Nvidia, our contour detector provides uncompromised contour accuracy, with an F-metric of 0.70 on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset. Runtime is reduced from 4 minutes to 1.8 seconds. The efﬁciency gains we realize enable high-quality image contour detection on much larger images than previously practical, and the algorithms we propose are applicable to several image segmentation approaches. Efﬁcient, scalable, yet highly accurate image contour detection will facilitate increased performance in many computer vision applications.},

Our contour detector combines multiple local cues into a globalization framework based on spectral clustering. Our segmentation algorithm consists of generic machinery for transforming the output of any contour detector into a hierarchical region tree. In this manner, we reduce the problem of image segmentation to that of contour detection. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that both our contour detection and segmentation methods signiﬁcantly outperform competing algorithms. The automatically generated hierarchical segmentations can be interactively reﬁned by userspeciﬁed annotations.

By edge and line oriented we mean methods that do not rely on segmentation. Distinction is made between edges and contours. Contour detectors are divided in local and global operators. The former are mainly based on differential analysis, statistical approaches, phase congruency, rank order ﬁlters, and combinations thereof. The latter include computation of contour saliency, perceptual grouping, relaxation labeling and active contours. Important aspects are covered, such as preprocessing aimed to suppress texture and noise, multiresolution techniques, connections between computational models and properties of the human visual system, and use of shape priors. An overview of procedures and metrics for quantitative performance evaluation is also presented. Our main conclusion is that contour detection has reached high degree of sophistication, taking into account multimodal contour deﬁnition (by luminance, color or texture changes), mechanisms for reducing the contour masking inﬂuence of noise and texture, perceptual grouping, multiscale aspects and high-level vision information.},

The aim of this study is to measure the precision and accuracy of the timing mechanisms of some of the most popular software packages used in a typical laboratory scenario in order to assess whether presentation times configured by researchers do not differ from measured times more than what is expected due to the hardware limitations. Despite the apparent precision and accuracy of the results, important issues related to timing setups in the presentation of visual stimuli were found, and they should be taken into account by researchers in their experiments.},

	abstract = {Many researchers in the behavioral sciences depend on research software that presents stimuli, and records response times, with sub-millisecond precision. There are a large number of software packages with which to conduct these behavioral experiments and measure response times and performance of participants. Very little information is available, however, on what timing performance they achieve in practice. Here we report a wide-ranging study looking at the precision and accuracy of visual and auditory stimulus timing and response times, measured with a Black Box Toolkit. We compared a range of popular packages: PsychoPy, E-PrimeÒ, NBS PresentationÒ, Psychophysics Toolbox, OpenSesame, Expyriment, Gorilla, jsPsych, Lab.js and Testable. Where possible, the packages were tested on Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu, and in a range of browsers for the online studies, to try to identify common patterns in performance. Among the lab-based experiments, Psychtoolbox, PsychoPy, Presentation and E-Prime provided the best timing, all with mean precision under 1 millisecond across the visual, audio and response measures. OpenSesame had slightly less precision across the board, but most notably in audio stimuli and Expyriment had rather poor precision. Across operating systems, the pattern was that precision was generally very slightly better under Ubuntu than Windows, and that macOS was the worst, at least for visual stimuli, for all packages. Online studies did not deliver the same level of precision as lab-based systems, with slightly more variability in all measurements. That said, PsychoPy and Gorilla, broadly the best performers, were achieving very close to millisecond precision on several browser/operating system combinations. For response times (measured using a high-performance button box), most of the packages achieved precision at least under 10 ms in all browsers, with PsychoPy achieving a precision under 3.5 ms in all. There was considerable variability between OS/browser combinations, especially in audio-visual synchrony which is the least precise aspect of the browser-based experiments. Nonetheless, the data indicate that online methods can be suitable for a wide range of studies, with due thought about the sources of variability that result. The results, from over 110,000 trials, highlight the wide range of timing qualities that can occur even in these dedicated software packages for the task. We stress the importance of scientists making their own timing validation measurements for their own stimuli and computer conﬁguration.},

	abstract = {The increasing interest in Virtual Reality (VR) as a tool for neuroscientific research contrasts with the current lack of established toolboxes and standards. In several recent studies, game engines like Unity or Unreal Engine were used. It remains to be tested whether these software packages provide sufficiently precise and accurate stimulus timing and time measurements that allow inferring ongoing mental and neural processes. We here investigated the precision and accuracy of the timing mechanisms of Unreal Engine 4 and SteamVR in combination with the HTC Vive VR system. In a first experiment, objective external measures revealed that stimulus durations were highly accurate. In contrast, in a second experiment, the assessment of the precision of built-in timing procedures revealed highly variable reaction time measurements and inaccurate determination of stimulus onsets. Hence, we developed a new software-based method that allows precise and accurate reaction time measurements with Unreal Engine and SteamVR. Instead of using the standard timing procedures implemented within Unreal Engine, time acquisition was outsourced to a background application. Timing benchmarks revealed that the newly developed method allows reaction time measurements with a precision and accuracy in the millisecond range. Overall, the present results indicate that the HTC Vive together with Unreal Engine and SteamVR can achieve high levels of precision and accuracy both concerning stimulus duration and critical time measurements. The latter can be achieved using a newly developed routine that allows not only accurate reaction time measures but also provides precise timing parameters that can be used in combination with time-sensitive functional measures such as electroencephalography (EEG) or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).},

	abstract = {Category theory is unmatched in its ability to organize and layer abstractions and to find commonalities between structures of all sorts. No longer the exclusive preserve of pure mathematicians, it is now proving itself to be a powerful tool in science, informatics, and industry. By facilitating communication between communities and building rigorous bridges between disparate worlds, applied category theory has the potential to be a major organizing force. This book offers a self-contained tour of applied category theory. Each chapter follows a single thread motivated by a real-world application and discussed with category-theoretic tools. We see data migration as an adjoint functor, electrical circuits in terms of monoidal categories and operads, and collaborative design via enriched profunctors. All the relevant category theory, from simple to sophisticated, is introduced in an accessible way with many examples and exercises, making this an ideal guide even for those without experience of university-level mathematics.},

He exposes the extraordinary capabilities, and also the faults and biases, of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior. He reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives, and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. This author's work has transformed cognitive psychology and launched the new fields of behavioral economics and happiness studies.

It is possible to recognize an emotion through several ways; however, this paper focuses on facial expressions, presenting a systematic review on the matter. In addition, 112 papers published in ACM, IEEE, BASE and Springer between January 2006 and April 2019 regarding this topic were extensively reviewed. Their most used methods and algorithms will be firstly introduced and summarized for a better understanding, such as face detection, smoothing, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Optical Flow (OF), Gabor filters, among others. This review identified a clear difficulty in translating the high facial expression recognition (FER) accuracy in controlled environments to uncontrolled and pose-variant environments. The future efforts in the FER field should be put into multimodal systems that are robust enough to face the adversities of real world scenarios. A thorough analysis on the research done on FER in Computer Vision based on the selected papers is presented. This review aims to not only become a reference for future research on emotion recognition, but also to provide an overview of the work done in this topic for potential readers.},

Certain problems regarding the formal tractability of UML Satechart Diagrams are addressed, such as the confusion over states and connectors, the flattening effect of boundary-crossing transitions, and the consequences of inverting the inter-level priority rule for handling concurrent events. A set-theoretic formal treatment of object states, events, guards and run-tocompletion processing is given, describing both serial and concurrent Statecharts.},

In order to support type-safe user interfaces, i.e., interfaces where users can only input type-correct data (types can be standard types of a programming language as well as any computable predicate on the data), we propose a set of type-oriented building blocks from which interfaces for more complex types can be easily constructed.

We describe eight recurring patterns that we have identi®ed as being used for DSL design and implementation. Existing languages can be extended, restricted, partially used, or become hosts for DSLs. Simple DSLs can be implemented by lexical processing. In addition, DSLs can be used to create front-ends to existing systems or to express complicated data structures. Finally, DSLs can be combined using process pipelines. The patterns described form a pattern language that can be used as a building block for a systematic view of the software development process involving DSLs. Ó 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Given the use and reach of visual social media platforms like Instagram and the paucity of research focusing on the platform, the potential for contagion effects via a social media platform like Instagram should be considered. As such, understanding conversations about suicide on Instagram is of interest to health communicators, public health professionals, and mental health professionals alike.
Method: This study examines both the visual and textual components of suicide-themed posts on social media platform Instagram. A random sample of 500 Instagram posts including the hashtags \#suicide and/or \#suicidal were extracted from a larger sample collected during March-June 2016. Results: Results show that self-harm was present in a majority of Instagram posts, and that posts that mention suicide ideation elicited higher engagement than posts that did not. Public health voices were largely absent from the conversation surrounding suicide on Instagram. Finally, few of the constructive WHO recommendations to prevent media contagion were visible in the study sample. These guidelines should be considered for participation in suicide-related online conversations.
Conclusions: Instagram appears to be used frequently for suicide-related communications. Public health and mental health professionals should consider increased involvement on this platform, as well as application of the WHO suicide contagion media guidelines.},

	abstract = {Associated with the functional style of programming is an algebra of programs whose variables range over programs and whose operations are combining forms. This algebra can be used to transform programs and to solve equations whose "unknowns" are programs in much the same way one transforms equations in high school algebra. These transformations are given by algebraic laws and are carried out in the same language in which programs are written. Combining forms are chosen not only for their programming power but also for the power of their associated algebraic laws. General theorems of the algebra give the detailed behavior and termination conditions for large classes of programs. A new class of computing systems uses the functional programming style both in its programming language and in its state transition rules. Unlike yon Neumann languages, these systems have semantics loosely coupled to states--only one state transition occurs per major computation.},

	abstract = {The reuse of code fragments by copying and pasting is widely practiced in software development and results in code clones. Cloning is considered an anti-pattern as it negatively affects program correctness and increases maintenance efforts. Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) software is no exception in the code clone discussion as reuse in development and maintenance is frequently achieved through copy, paste, and modiﬁcation. Even though the presence of code clones may not necessary be a problem per se, it is important to detect, track and manage clones as the software system evolves. Unfortunately, tool support for clone detection and management is not commonly available for PLC software systems or limited to generic tools with a reduced set of features. In this paper, we investigate code clones in a real-world PLC software system based on IEC 61131-3 Structured Text and C/C++. We extended a widely used tool for clone detection with normalization support. Furthermore, we evaluated the different types and natures of code clones in the studied system and their relevance for refactoring. Results shed light on the applicability and usefulness of clone detection in the context of industrial automation systems and it demonstrates the beneﬁt of adapting detection and management tools for IEC 611313-3 languages.},

              This case focuses on valuation using various methods to price a firm. Students attempting this case should know the basics of how to value a company using discounted cash flow, comparable multiples and comparable transactions. Students will need to calculate the weighted average cost of capital using comparable companies and the capital asset pricing model and determine differences in value created by an acquisition vs a leveraged buyout (LBO). The case also discusses qualitative issues in mergers, such as fit between target and acquirer, integration issues, potential high debt from LBO.
            
            
              Research methodology

              Case overview/synopsis
              Whole Foods Markets received a buyout offer from Amazon. Whole Foods could solicit offers from other firms, including firms more directly in the grocery business. Whole Foods also considered a management buyout or purchase by a private equity firm. Whole Foods had underperformed, with a falling stock price and reduced profitability. Amazon’s bid was attractive, a premium of about 40 per cent over Whole Foods’ pre-merger stock price. Whole Foods also wanted to consider issues such as culture. Whole Foods’ strategy was to sell organic foods at premium prices, while Amazon was a retail discounter with a largely online business.
            
            
              Complexity academic level
              This case is appropriate for graduate students at the end of their introductory course or for graduate or undergraduate students in a corporate finance elective, particularly a merger/restructuring elective. The case has been used in an advanced undergraduate finance elective, with a team presenting the case to the class, with remaining students in the class required to write case summaries and questions for the presenting group.},

Further, in terms of a comparison between the participants’ mental models and their performance in incourse assessments and ﬁnal examination, it was found that students with viable mental models performed signiﬁcantly better than those with non-viable models. These ﬁndings are used to propose a more “constructivist” approach to teaching programming based on the integration of “cognitive conﬂict” and program visualisation.},

Research has shown that high selfefficacy and a good mental model are important to knowledge acquisition and transfer. This research investigates the effects of students’ self-efficacy and mental models of programming on learning to program. The results show that self-efficacy for programming is influenced by previous programming experience and increases as a student progresses through an introductory programming course. The results also show that the student’s mental model of programming influences self-efficacy and that both the mental model and self-efficacy affect course performance.},

One key aspect of this theoretical approach is the distinction between two kinds of representation the reader might construct from a text: the textbase and the situation model. On the basis of results of an experiment we have conducted, we evaluate the cognitive validity of this distinction in OO program understanding. We examine how the construction of these two representations is differentially affected by the programmer's expertise and how they evolve differentially over time.},

Firstly, a teaching model based on either visualisation alone or cognitive conflict integrated with visualisation can help students develop viable models of value assignment. Secondly, there was evidence to suggest that cognitive conflict integrated with visualisation outperformed visualisation alone in helping students develop viable models of the more challenging concept of object reference assignment. And thirdly, there was evidence of an improvement in students’ understanding of value and object reference assignment using the teaching model based on visualisation and cognitive conflict.},

	abstract = {This study explores the dynamics of energy use patterns, climate change issues and the relationship between social-psychological factors, with residents’ acceptance of and willingness to pay (WTP) for home energy management systems (HEMS) during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York. The results of our survey suggest that there were no longer morning or evening usage peaks on weekdays, and a significant portion of respondents are experiencing higher or much higher electricity use than average. Most residents' perception of climate change issues during COVID-19 remained unchanged. Attitude, perceived behavioral control, and social norms are overall the strongest predictors of adoption intention and WTP for HEMS. Regarding WTP for specific wellbeing features, attitude was the strongest positive predictor of telemedical and home security features, and social norms are the strongest positive predictor of elderly assistance and job search. Technology anxiety, surprisingly, positively influences WTP for the well-being features. Trust in utilities is not related to adoption intention, but is positively associated with WTP for the well-being features. Although cybersecurity concerns are positively as­ sociated with HEMS adoption intention for energy and well-being features, this relationship is not significant in WTP. Residents who had moderate perceived risk of getting COVID-19 are willing to pay more than the highand low-risk groups. This paper addresses the interactions among technology attributes, and users’ social-psy­ chological and demographics factors. Additionally, this study provides insights for further research in examining technology adoption and energy dynamics during times of crises, such as the COVID-19.},

Crucially, network and personality features interacted to predict individuals’ centrality: people high in well-being (i.e., life satisfaction and positive emotion) were central to networks characterized by fun, whereas people high in empathy were central to networks characterized by trust. Together, these findings provide network-based corroboration of psychological evidence that well-being is socially attractive, whereas empathy supports close relationships. More broadly, these data highlight how an individual’s personality relates to the roles that they play in sustaining their community.},

However, emerging evidence suggests that heterogeneity exists with respect to links between adversity and resilience, with adversity often enhancing cooperation in the face of joint suffering. Here, the authors present 2 studies designed to examine if the severity of past adversity is associated with an enduring propensity for empathy-mediated compassion, and, if so, whether the resulting compassion directly is, in turn, linked to behavior meant to relieve the suffering of others. Using both MTurk and laboratory-based paradigms, the authors find that increasing severity of past adversity predicts increased empathy, which in turn, is linked to a stable tendency to feel compassion for others in need. In addition, they demonstrate that the resulting individual differences in compassion appear to engender behavioral responses meant to assist others (i.e., charitable giving, helping a stranger).},

Across studies, relative to their upper-class counterparts, lower-class individuals reported elevated dispositional compassion (Study 1), as well as greater self-reported compassion during a compassion-inducing video (Study 2) and for another person during a social interaction (Study 3). Lower-class individuals also exhibited heart rate deceleration—a physiological response associated with orienting to the social environment and engaging with others— during the compassion-inducing video (Study 2).

On the other hand, empathy shifts with characteristics of empathizers and situations. These 2 characteristics of empathy can be reconciled by acknowledging the key role of motivation in driving people to avoid or approach engagement with others’ emotions. In particular, at least 3 phenomena—suffering, material costs, and interference with competition—motivate people to avoid empathy, and at least 3 phenomena—positive affect, affiliation, and social desirability—motivate them to approach empathy. Would-be empathizers carry out these motives through regulatory strategies including situation selection, attentional modulation, and appraisal, which alter the course of empathic episodes.

The ideomotor framework of human actions assumes a common representational format for action and perception that facilitates imitation. Furthermore, the associative sequence learning model of imitation proposes that experience-based Hebbian learning forms links between sensory processing of the actions of others and motor plans. Social psychology studies have demonstrated that imitation and mimicry are pervasive, automatic, and facilitate empathy. Neuroscience investigations have demonstrated physiological mechanisms of mirroring at single-cell and neural-system levels that support the cognitive and social psychology constructs. Why were these neural mechanisms selected, and what is their adaptive advantage? Neural mirroring solves the “problem of other minds” (how we can access and understand the minds of others) and makes intersubjectivity possible, thus facilitating social behavior.},

What is well established is that people typically display a group bias, such that they more readily have empathy for the pain and suffering of ingroup members than they do for outgroup members. I review current research that attempts to answer four main questions about intergroup empathy: (a) what is the role of empathy in prejudice and prejudice reduction? (b) what are the causes and consequences of counter-empathy? (c) how do mimicry and the mirror neuron system play a role? (d) how does the brain produce intergroup empathy? This review draws mainly from studies in social psychology, developmental psychology, and social neuroscience, reflecting a variety of behavioral and neuroscience measures to examine the interplay between prejudice, empathy, counter-empathy, and mimicry, as well as the brain regions that underlie these processes.},

	abstract = {Put simply, empathy refers to understanding what another person is experiencing or trying to express. Therapist empathy has a long history as a hypothesized key change process in psychotherapy. We begin by discussing definitional issues and presenting an integrative definition. We then review measures of therapist empathy, including the conceptual problem of separating empathy from other relationship variables. We follow this with clinical examples illustrating different forms of therapist empathy and empathic response modes. The core of our review is a meta-analysis of research on the relation between therapist empathy and client outcome. Results indicated that empathy is a moderately strong predictor of therapy outcome: mean weighted r = .28 (p {\textless} .001; 95\% confidence interval: .23 –.33; equivalent of d = .58) for 82 independent samples and 6,138 clients. In general, the empathy-outcome relation held for different theoretical orientations and client presenting problems; however, there was considerable heterogeneity in the effects. Client, observer, and therapist perception measures predicted client outcome better than empathic accuracy measures. We then consider the limitations of the current data. We conclude with diversity considerations and practice recommendations, including endorsing the different forms that empathy may take in therapy. Clinical Impact Statement Question: Does therapist empathy predict success in psychotherapy? Findings: In general, clients have moderately better outcomes in psychotherapy when clients, therapists and observers perceive therapists as understanding them. Meaning: Empathy is an important element of any therapeutic relationship, and worth the investment of time and effort required to do it well and consistently. Next Steps: Careful research using diverse methods is needed to firmly establish and explain the causal role of therapist empathy in bringing about client outcome; clinicians can contribute by identifying situations in which empathy may be particularly valuable or conversely contraindicated.},

We meta-analytically examined 304 independent samples to uncover unique effects of perspective taking and empathic concern on important work-related outcomes. We develop and test a contingency model of those effects, based on three facets of psychological interdependence: outcome, hierarchical (or power asymmetry), and social category (or in-group/out-group distinctions). Results revealed perspective taking and empathic concern to have positive impacts on being supportive of others, but the effects of empathic concern were stronger. In contrast, perspective taking was an asset and empathy was a liability for capturing value in strategic interactions (e.g., negotiations). Effects of perspective taking and empathic concern were differentially contingent on psychological interdependence. The impact of perspective taking, but not of empathic concern, was attenuated or reversed under negative outcome interdependence; perspective-taking leads to advantage taking in competitive contexts. Perspective taking was particularly beneficial when the actor had high power, but empathic concern’s benefits were independent of hierarchy. Finally, social dissimilarity had no detectable impact on the effects of perspective taking or empathic concern, contrary to our theorizing. Overall results suggest two key conclusions. First, perspective taking and empathic concern have powerful effects on work-related outcomes. Second, each construct has its own distinctive and predictable impacts. We conclude by offering practical suggestions for improving workplace interactions through perspective taking and empathic concern.},

This article offers a process-focused approach emphasizing the relational functions of empathy in interpersonal contexts.

Our aim is to enrich current conceptualizations and empirical approaches to the study of empathy by drawing on psychological, philosophical, medical, linguistic, and anthropological perspectives. In doing so, we highlight the various functions of empathy in social interaction, underscore some underemphasized components in empirical studies of empathy, and make recommendations for future research on this important area in the study of emotion.},

On the basis of the approach/inhibition theory of power (Keltner, Gruenfeld, \& Anderson, 2003), we hypothesized that elevated social power is associated with diminished reciprocal emotional responses to another person’s suffering (feeling distress at another person’s distress) and with diminished complementary emotion (e.g., compassion). In face-to-face conversations, participants disclosed experiences that had caused them suffering. As predicted, participants with a higher sense of power experienced less distress and less compassion and exhibited greater autonomic emotion regulation when confronted with another participant’s suffering. Additional analyses revealed that these ﬁndings could not be attributed to power-related differences in baseline emotion or decoding accuracy, but were likely shaped by power-related differences in the motivation to afﬁliate. Implications for theorizing about power and the social functions of emotions are discussed.},

By integrating research on empathy gaps for physical pain (Loewenstein, 1996) with social pain theory (MacDonald \& Leary, 2005), the authors generated the hypothesis that people generally underestimate the severity of social pain (ostracism, shame, etc.)—a biased judgment that is only corrected when people actively experience social pain for themselves. Using a social exclusion manipulation, Studies 1– 4 found that nonexcluded participants consistently underestimated the severity of social pain compared with excluded participants, who had a heightened appreciation for social pain. This empathy gap for social pain occurred when participants evaluated both the pain of others (interpersonal empathy gap) as well as the pain participants themselves experienced in the past (intrapersonal empathy gap). The authors argue that beliefs about social pain are important because they govern how people react to socially distressing events. In Study 5, middle school teachers were asked to evaluate policies regarding emotional bullying at school. This revealed that actively experiencing social pain heightened the estimated pain of emotional bullying, which in turn led teachers to recommend both more comprehensive treatment for bullied students and greater punishment for students who bully.},

	abstract = {Objective To compare two perspective taking strategies on (i) clinicians’ ability to accurately identify negative thoughts and feelings of parents of children with cancer, and (ii) clinician distress.
Methods Sixty-three hematology-oncology professionals and nursing students watched a video featuring parents of children with cancer. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups. In the imagine-self group, they were instructed to imagine the feelings and life consequences which they would experience if they were in the parents’ position. In the imagineother group, they were instructed to imagine the feelings and life consequences experienced by the parents. Parent-clinician agreement on thoughts/feelings was evaluated (standard stimulus paradigm). Clinician distress was also assessed.
Results The intervention was effective in manipulating perspective type. The groups did not significantly differ on parent-clinician agreement. Concentrating on personal feelings (imagineself strategy) did predict lower agreement when controlling for trait empathy. Clinician distress was higher in the imagine-self group.
Conclusion Although the link between perspective type and detection of distress remains unclear, the results suggest that clinicians who highly focus on their own feelings tend to be less accurate on parental distress and experience more distress themselves.},

In this study we test the hypothesis that empathy-evoked activation in the pain network leads to heightened pain perception. After inducing in half of our subjects a state of high empathy for an actor and in the other half a state of low empathy towards him, we measured the sensitivity to heat stimuli of various intensities in healthy participants while they watched the actor being exposed to similar stimuli. Participants in the ‘‘high-empathy’’ group rated painful (but not non-painful) stimuli applied to themselves as more intense and unpleasant than did those in the ‘‘low-empathy’’ group. Positive correlations between state empathy scores and pain ratings further suggest that this perceptual phenomenon depends on the magnitude of empathic response induced in the participants. The eﬀects were observed when subjects watched the model receiving either neutral or painful stimuli, suggesting that it is empathy itself that alters pain perception, and not necessarily the observation of pain behaviors.},

In this review, we integrate three evolutionary arguments that converge on the hypothesis that compassion evolved as a distinct affective experience whose primary function is to facilitate cooperation and protection of the weak and those who suffer. Our empirical review reveals compassion to have distinct appraisal processes attuned to undeserved suffering, distinct signaling behavior related to caregiving patterns of touch, posture, and vocalization, and a phenomenological experience and physiological response that orients the individual to social approach. This response profile of compassion differs from those of distress, sadness, and love, suggesting that compassion is indeed a distinct emotion. We conclude by considering how compassion shapes moral judgment and action, how it varies across different cultures, and how it may engage specific patterns of neural activation, as well as emerging directions of research.},

We evaluate the spread of long-term emotional states across a social network. We introduce a novel form of the classical susceptible–infected–susceptible disease model which includes the possibility for ‘spontaneous’ (or ‘automatic’) infection, in addition to disease transmission (the SISa model). Using this framework and data from the Framingham Heart Study, we provide formal evidence that positive and negative emotional states behave like infectious diseases spreading across social networks over long periods of time. The probability of becoming content is increased by 0.02 per year for each content contact, and the probability of becoming discontent is increased by 0.04 per year per discontent contact. Our mathematical formalism allows us to derive various quantities from the data, such as the average lifetime of a contentment ‘infection’ (10 years) or discontentment ‘infection’ (5 years). Our results give insight into the transmissive nature of positive and negative emotional states. Determining to what extent particular emotions or behaviours are infectious is a promising direction for further research with important implications for social science, epidemiology and health policy. Our model provides a theoretical framework for studying the interpersonal spread of any state that may also arise spontaneously, such as emotions, behaviours, health states, ideas or diseases with reservoirs.},

We propose an appraisal theory of vicarious emotional experiences, including empathy, based on appraisal theories of emotion. According to this theory, emotions for others are based on how we evaluate their situations, just as firsthand emotions are based on how we evaluate our own situations. We discuss how this framework can predict empathic emotion matching and also the experience of emotions for others that do not match what they feel.

It has evolved in the context of parental care for offspring, as well as within kinship bonds, to help facilitate group living. In this paper, we integrate the perspectives of evolution, animal behaviour, developmental psychology, and social and clinical neuroscience to elucidate our understanding of the proximate mechanisms underlying empathy. We focus, in particular, on processing of signals of distress and need, and their relation to prosocial behaviour. The ability to empathize, both in animals and humans, mediates prosocial behaviour when sensitivity to others' distress is paired with a drive towards their welfare. Disruption or atypical development of the neural circuits that process distress cues and integrate them with decision value leads to callous disregard for others, as is the case in psychopathy. The realization that basic forms of empathy exist in non-human animals is crucial for gaining new insights into the underlying neurobiological and genetic mechanisms of empathy, enabling translation towards therapeutic and pharmacological interventions.},

For return-beneﬁts to play a motivational role, however, they need to be experienced by the organism. Motivational analyses should restrict themselves, therefore, to the altruistic impulse and its knowable consequences. Empathy is an ideal candidate mechanism to underlie so-called directed altruism, i.e., altruism in response to another’s pain, need, or distress. Evidence is accumulating that this mechanism is phylogenetically ancient, probably as old as mammals and birds. Perception of the emotional state of another automatically activates shared representations causing a matching emotional state in the observer. With increasing cognition, state-matching evolved into more complex forms, including concern for the other and perspective-taking. Empathy-induced altruism derives its strength from the emotional stake it offers the self in the other’s welfare. The dynamics of the empathy mechanism agree with predictions from kin selection and reciprocal altruism theory.},

There was a significant amount of work in the 1980’s on this topic, but it mostly died out in the 1990s. Now, there is a resurgence of work on what used to be called the Psychology of Programming, Software Psychology, and the Empirical Studies of Programming. Now, research that combines HCI and software engineering concerns regularly wins awards at both the software engineering and HCI conferences, and although there is no longer a conference devoted solely to this topic, it is a major focus of the popular VL/HCC conference series. In this paper, we argue that new HCI and software engineering methods and tools, along with a new acceptance of the programming community, makes it a propitious time for a renewed focus on this topic.},

We aim to provide an overview of the common pitfalls and potential disadvantages of visual representations based on a multidisciplinary literature review. Subsequently, we develop a theoretically grounded classification of common cognitive, emotional, and social risks of visualization and populate it with a comprehensive list of visualization pitfalls. The aim of this research is not to diminish the potential of visualization, but rather to improve visual literacy by structuring our understanding of the possible limitations of graphic representations.},

	abstract = {Visual notations form an integral part of the language of software engineering (SE). Yet historically, SE researchers and notation designers have ignored or undervalued issues of visual representation. In evaluating and comparing notations, details of visual syntax are rarely discussed. In designing notations, the majority of effort is spent on semantics, with graphical conventions largely an afterthought. Typically, no design rationale, scientific or otherwise, is provided for visual representation choices. While SE has developed mature methods for evaluating and designing semantics, it lacks equivalent methods for visual syntax. This paper defines a set of principles for designing cognitively effective visual notations: ones that are optimized for human communication and problem solving. Together these form a design theory, called the Physics of Notations as it focuses on the physical (perceptual) properties of notations rather than their logical (semantic) properties. The principles were synthesized from theory and empirical evidence from a wide range of fields and rest on an explicit theory of how visual notations communicate. They can be used to evaluate, compare, and improve existing visual notations as well as to construct new ones. The paper identifies serious design flaws in some of the leading SE notations, together with practical suggestions for improving them. It also showcases some examples of visual notation design excellence from SE and other fields.},

	abstract = {Background: School-aged children and adolescents exposed to domestic violence (DV) disproportionality attend to threatening and sad cues in their environment. This bias in attention has been found to predict elevations in symptoms of psychopathology. Studies have yet to explore attention biases using eyetracking technology in preschool-aged children with DV exposure.
Objective: This study investigated whether preschool-aged children exposed to DV show vigilance to angry and sad faces versus happy faces and a target non-face stimulus relative to non-exposed children, and whether such vigilance relates to child social-emotional development. Participants and setting: Preschool-aged children were recruited from a large, diverse, urban community. DV-exposed children were recruited from a dyadic, mother-child treatment group speciﬁcally designed for, and restricted to, mothers who have experienced domestic violence (DV-exposed group, n = 23). Children with no prior exposure to DV and their mothers were recruited within the same community (non-exposed group, n = 32).
Methods: Children completed an eye-tracking task to assess their attention to face stimuli and mothers rated their children's social-emotional development. Total duration of ﬁxations were analyzed.
Results: Results showed that DV-exposed children have a signiﬁcantly stronger attention bias away from sad faces (p = 0.03; d = 0.62) and neutral faces (p = 0.02; d = 0.70) relative to nonexposed children, and this attention bias away from sad and neutral faces is associated with child social-emotional problems. Contrary to our hypothesis, no bias towards anger was found for DVexposed versus non-exposed children.
Conclusions: This study contributes to growing evidence that young children's negative attention biases inﬂuence functioning and have important implications for children's well-being and development.},

Studies have indicated that the amygdala plays an important role in eye contact, and amygdala dysfunction may underlie social deﬁcits in disorders such as autism through effects on eye contact. In the present study we compared the volume of the amygdala in 32 juvenile rhesus monkeys to visual ﬁxation patterns in a social memory paradigm. Amygdala volume was determined from manual traces of structural MRIs and ﬁxation patterns were assessed using eyetracking methodology. A signiﬁcant positive relationship was found between amygdala volume and ﬁxation on both the face and the eye region. Amygdala volume was also found to relate to habituation across multiple presentations of different photographs of the same individual monkeys indicating a role in social memory. These data provide an important linkage between structural variation of amygdala and previous demonstrations of function in a nonhuman primate model.},

	doi = {10.1016/s0167-5273(00)00172-8},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To date, the use of beta-blockers in treating patients with chronic heart failure gains support, this since several large clinical trials reported reduced mortality after chronic beta-blockade. Part of these beneficial effects may result from inhibition of deleterious neurohormone activation that accompanies progression of chronic heart failure. The present study evaluates whether this neurohormone inhibition is preserved after chronic beta-blockade.
METHODS: In a retrospective analysis the neurohormonal profiles of patients with moderate to severe chronic heart failure were studied from three treatment subgroups: (1) Without beta-blockers or ACE-inhibitors (n=15), (2) without beta-blockers, with ACE-inhibitors (n=324), (3) with beta-blockers and ACE-inhibitors (n=31). Patients were on beta-blockers for an average period of 3.8 years. Plasma samples were obtained under controlled conditions.
RESULTS: Despite uneven group sizes, the groups were well matched for clinical characteristics. Plasma renin levels were significantly lower in patients treated adjunctively with beta-blockers. Plasma aldosterone and endothelin-I levels also tended to be lower after chronic beta-blockade, however, this did not reach statistical significance.
CONCLUSIONS: Chronic adjunctive beta-blocker treatment shows significantly lower plasma renin levels when compared to single ACE-inhibition. This persistent reduction of plasma neurohormone activation may concomitantly reduce the chance of neurohormones to escape from inhibition.},

            This study reviews theory and results from developmental psychology to examine age differences in workplace achievement goals. We investigated whether goal level decreases with age and, by comparing the relative strength of different goals within individuals, we examined whether dominant achievement goals are related to age. In a large sample of employees (N=747), older workers' higher affective commitment and intrinsic motivation compensated for age-related decline in the importance of achievement goals. Whether learning-approach and learning-avoidance were dominant goals was not related to age but instead to skill level, affective commitment and intrinsically satisfying work. Dominant performance-approach goals were more common among males. Performance-avoidance was most likely to be a dominant goal among older males. Moreover, with age, performance-goal orientations had increasingly maladaptive consequences for self-efficacy and affect at work.},

This research aims to explore young children’s approaches to programming in two tools with contrasting programming interfaces, ScratchJr and Lightbot, and considers the impact of programming approaches on developing computational thinking. A study was conducted using two versions of a Lightbot-style game, either using a ScratchJr-like or Lightbot style programming interface. A test of non-verbal reasoning was used to perform a matched assignment of 40, 6 and 7-year-olds to the two conditions. Each child then played their version of the game for 30 minutes. The results showed that both groups had similar overall performance, but as expected, the children using the ScratchJr-like interface performed more program manipulation or ‘tinkering’. The most interesting finding was that non-verbal reasoning was a predictor of program manipulation, but only for the ScratchJr-like condition. Children approached the ScratchJr-like program differently depending on prior ability. More research is required to establish how children use programming tools and how these approaches influence computational thinking.},
