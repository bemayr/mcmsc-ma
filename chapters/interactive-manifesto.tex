    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{Individuals and interactions} over processes and tools.
        \item \emph{Building the shared theory} over processes and tools.
        
        \item \emph{Working software} over comprehensive documentation.
        \item \emph{Tangible experiences} over comprehensive documentation.
        
        \item \emph{Customer collaboration} over contract negotiation.
        \item \emph{Customer collaboration} for contract negotiation.

        \item \emph{Responding to change} over following a plan.
        \item \emph{Mutual exploration} over following a plan.
    \end{itemize}
    %
