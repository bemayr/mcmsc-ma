Another motivational factor for making comments executable is the author's involvement in the StateML\footnote{\url{https://www.stateml.org/}} project, which aims at providing a shared visual language for modeling event-driven behavior based on Statecharts \cite{Harel:1987}.
This multi-modal (visual, textual, $\dotsc$) language enables the cooperative definition and development of behavior by providing live-visualizations for non-developers.
StateML artifacts can be simulated, but the language itself is not executable, it must be embedded in a host programming language which executes all side effects.
To fully utilize the potential of Statecharts and improve stakeholder collaboration in agile and incremental software development processes, it is necessary to partially execute those models of behavior.
% During simulation mode, hole-driven comments can act as simulated side-effects while providing the base for future implementation via their textual description.
